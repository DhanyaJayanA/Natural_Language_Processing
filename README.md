## Natural_Language_Processing 
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of artificial intelligence or AI— concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

**Text preprocessing**
* Removing punctuations
* Removing Space
* Removing digits
* Removing Stop words
* Lower casing
* Tokenization
* Stemming
* Lemmatization

**Feature Engineering**
* Bag of word
* CountVectorizer
* TF_IDF
* Word Embedding

### Text Classification

Text classification analyze text and then assign a set of predefined tags or categories based on its context.

### Topic modeling
The statistical process of learning and extracting topics from huge amount of documents is called topic modeling. Unsupervised learning: where data is not structured and don’t have labels.

By topic modeling you can

  * Group similar words together.
  
  * Group similar document/comments together.
  
 1. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. <a href="https://github.com/DhanyaJayanA/Natural_Language_Processing/blob/main/Topic_Modeling.ipynb"> Code </a>
